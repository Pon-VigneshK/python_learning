Variables:
    - Variables are containers for storing data values. Python has no command for declaring a variable.
    - A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore(_) character
    - A variable name cannot start with a number
    - A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and - )
    - Variable names are case-sensitive (name, Name and NAME are three different variables)
Example :
# name="Pon Vignesh"
# User_name="Pon Vignesh"

id() --> is a built-in Function
    - All objects in Python has its own unique id. 
    - The id is assigned to the object when it is created.
    - The id is the object's memory address, and will be different for each time you run the program

type() --> is a built-in Function
    - The type is used to return the type of data stored in the objects or variables in the program.
    - For example, if a variable contains a value of 45.5 then the type of that variable is float.

Keywords: 
    - Keywords are the reserved words in Python.
    - We cannot use a keyword as a variable name, function name or any other identifier.
    - Keywords are case sensitive in Python.
